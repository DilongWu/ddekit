This is an example of DDEKit-Linux and dde-linux2.6, running the Intel e1000e
network interface card device driver in user space.

All files except the Makefile, tap.c, tap.h, tun.c, handle.c, and main.c
are part of the device driver.

This example uses the e1000e device driver to control a NIC and receive
packets. The NIC is put in promiscous mode. A receive handler is registered
with dde-linux-2.6. All received packets are forwarded to a TAP interface,
which is created by the application. Simultaneously, packets read from the
TAP interface are handed to dde-linux2.6 to be transmitted by the NIC.

tap.c, tap.h, and tun.c handle creation of the TAP interface.
handle.c containes code to read from and write to the TAP interface.
main.c interfaces with dde-linux2.6 and manages program startup and shutdown,
and contains some glue code.

To build this example, the path to the DDEKit-Linux directory, dde-linux2.6
build directory, and the dde-linux2.6 CPU configuration have to be edited
in the Makefile.
