To build user space part:
 - edit Makefile, so DDEKIT_INCLUDE points to the DDEKit header files
 - run make
 - libddekit.a is created

To build kernel modules:
 - boot kernel for which the modules shall be built
 - go to modules/ subdirectory
 - edit Kbuild file, so that ccflags-y variable point to the DDEKit header
   files
 - run make
 - run make modules_install
 - modules are now installed
 - the modules uio.ko, uio_pci_generic.ko and uio-dma.ko can now be loaded
 - watch out to load the just compiled uio.ko and uio_pci_generic.ko modules,
   and not standard modules, which may be installed
