To build DDEKit-Linux go to ddekit-linux and follow the instructions
in the README file
To build DDE-Linux2.6 go to dde-linux2.6 and follow the instructions
in the README file

Now link libddekit.a, libdde-linux26*.a and a device driver together to run
the driver in user space.
See e1000e_example directory for an example of an e1000e network device
driver, running in user space.

So far, only network device drivers are tested.
